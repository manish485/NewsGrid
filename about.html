                       <p>A well-organized paragraph starts with a strong topic sentence. You probably have seen a student paper in
                            which one paragraph consumes an entire page -- and maybe more. To break up this long block of type,
                            the student might reread the text and insert paragraph breaks to make the paper "easier on the eye."
                            Format & organization A good paragraph consists of three important parts- beginning, middle and conclusion.
                            This are the basic components of a paragraph.
                            But a paragraph must be written in a single paragraph on a single idea.

        Site structure of your news site. We've done a post on site structure for blogs, that largely applies for news websites as well.
         On your news website, you'll have articles on one side, and taxonomies, like categories and tags, on the other.
         Be aware of that second structure, as it might be more important than your articles that come and go.

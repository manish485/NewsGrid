        Site structure of your news site. We've done a post on site structure for blogs, that largely applies for news websites as well.
         On your news website, you'll have articles on one side, and taxonomies, like categories and tags, on the other.
         Be aware of that second structure, as it might be more important than your articles that come and go.
